Mar 26th:
        change the website for log and problem and summary, replaced by the html trasnformed from README markdown file. 
        try to input the xml data by spider from douban.

        code for the XSL-FO and find the hardness of the NavigatableString in bs4 of spider.
  

Mar 28th:
		github from han chang
		githubgithub test from yvon

## Problem:

		- my xsd and dtd are on the github.com. how can I refer them in xml?
		- I will transfer this web to https://coding.net/u/yvonshong/p/xml_course/git to check the dtd and schema.
        - in order to modufy the web of next.html to show our plan to sync this README.md, we will use the Pandoc to try to transfer the markdown file to html file.
        - rebuild the xslt to process the movie.xml 

##Summary:

        - iframe
        iframe is hard to be adaptive and to modularize. and there are some errors of link jumping. nestification and modularization are hard by html.
		- sync
         Git plus OneDrive are convenient for two computer which are used by the only one person.
		 the editor for web like sublime text, vs code. I find the vs code integrate the Git.
        - tools
         the online xml - xsl-fo -pdf transform  http://www.utilities-online.info/foprender/#
